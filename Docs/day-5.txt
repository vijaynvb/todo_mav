1. Docker Container Runtime Engine -> deploy our E Application on a single CRE 
    1. TodoAPI
    2. Mysql DB 
    3.....100

2. Deployment tool -> Docker Compose

    $ sudo apt-get install docker-compose
    $ nano docker-compose.yaml
        Paste docker compose content 
        Ctrl x, y enter
    $ ls
    $ sudo docker-compose up
    $ sudo docker-compose down

ports 
                 -> Host                    -> Container - 100 - horizonatal scaling
Windows [0-1024] -> wsl ubuntu [0-1024] 8086 -> todoapi [ubuntu os][0-1024] 8081 -> transport layer -> OS -> 
browser -> 172.x.x.50:8096 -> 8081 -> application
        -> localhost:8096

1. single point of failure 
2. scaling to multiple replicas is a challenge 
3. disaster management is very difficult
    observability and monitoring mechnaisum to manage application + infra 

Orcastration Tools -> 
    1. Cloud Providers Has it by default -> GCP 
    2. K8s -> K8s
    3. kata

K8s -> Cluster
        | OS1 [cpu, ram, io, network]  -> 
   Host | OS2 [cpu, ram, io, network] -> todoapi container -> pod
   nodes| OS3 [cpu, ram, io, network] -> mysql -> service discovey and load balancer - out of the box k8s has these features 
        | OS4 [cpu, ram, io, network] -> pod 1 [name, ip ]

k8s -> App Pod -> give me 3 instance of todoapi 
    1. pod 1 -> todoapi contianer -> istio service mesh container [observability containers]
    2. pod 2 -> todoapi contianer
    3. pod 3 -> todoapi contianer

Db Pods -> 
    4. pod 1 Mysql Container 

Architectural Style of Implementation: 
    1. One Master also a Node same system -> Docker desktop -> k8s service -> k8sadmin
    2. one master and one node two systems -> minikube, microk8s, kubeadm
    3. one master with n nodes n systems  -> minikube, microk8s, kubeadm
    4. integrated master with n nodes -> cloud providers [GKE, EKS, AKS service] -> multiple vm's as node 
    5. two masters with n nodes 
    6. n master with n nodes 

  master tainting -> tainted -> cannot be node 
                      untained -> can be node also
