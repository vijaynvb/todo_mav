What is an Apllication?
    solves a user specific problem using computer program. Solution for a given problem 

Program and Process is?
    1. program: Set of instructions for CPU -> static file .C, .Java
    2. process: execution of program -> CPU's -> when it is loaded into MM [Ram] and your processor is executing it 

Enterprice Application? 
    it's a combination application which are solving a business problem - Banking Domain -> [credit and debit transction]
        1. web portal [staff, users] -> MVC, API+React, JSP, 
        2. mobile app -> native, React Native, MAUI, Cordova
        3. ATM's -> Desktop - Applets, .net winforms 
        4. Backend Jobs -> shell scripts, cron jobs, Spring Batch 

What is Microservices? 
    microservices is a architectural pattern to develop EA

    architect -> tools -> CNCF

    Amazon.com -> 99.9 Uptime -> Deployment stratergy -> Blue Green Deployement -> Canray Deployment
        1000 services -> repo's -> executable -> delopy in infra 
        1 minunte -> upgrade or downgrade ->  11 services 
        TodoApi -> v1 -> v2

Whats the architecture of MS? 
ms principles 
    1. Modularity -> Modules -> MS in our infra 
    2. Hide Implementation -> MS -> any technoloy 
    3. Automation -> CI/CD Tools
    4. Scalable -> 99.9% uptime 
        1. veritical 
        2. horizontal 
    5. Uniform Resource identification -> Http URL mechanisum 
    6. Standrd Communitation Channel -> rest api's 

CNCF - Consotium 

1. Containerization of application MS -> App .jar + OS ubuntu
    1. dockers, alternative
2. Where to store your application -> Image -> Reigistry -> Docker hub, GCR  
    docker hub, gcr 
3. where to deploy the application -> 
    1. static infra -> 
        1. laptop -> docker desktop -> deploy the app 
        2. GCP -> VM static -> deploy your image/ container 
        3. GCP -> GKE -> Cluster Static -> deploy your application
    2. Dynamic infra -> qa -> test 
        Cloud Can provide VM's on a Button click -> deploy the app
            1. teraform 
            2. ansible
